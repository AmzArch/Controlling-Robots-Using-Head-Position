# Controlling-Robots-Using-Head-Position

This project focuses on using the Externally Guided Motion (EGM) feature of ABB robots, such as Yumi, to help individuals with limited or no arm function control the robot using their head position. This will make their lives easier and improve their quality of life.

To generate the EGM Proto Files, we used the ABB_EGM_PYTHON repository available at https://github.com/bestin-07/ABB_EGM_PYTHON.

Please refer to the documentation in the repository for further information on how to use the EGM feature of ABB robots and how to implement this project.

Contributions to this project are welcome. Please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

The video below showcases a successful test conducted on the YUMI Robot at ABB. I would like to express my gratitude to the Robotics Team at ABB India, Bengaluru for providing me with a wonderful experience and growth opportunity during my internship.
